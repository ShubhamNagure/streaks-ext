# Learning Streak Tracker â€“ System Overview

This Chrome extension helps you track daily learning streaks per topic (like "Java" or "Go"). You can mark a topic as done for the day, see your current streak, and visualize it on a 30-day heatmap. It also lets you back up your streak data to Google Sheets.

---

## How It Works

### Popup (popup.html + popup.js)
- Shows all your learning topics
- Lets you mark a topic as done for today
- Tracks your current streak and active days
- Shows a small 30-day heatmap
- Has buttons to add/remove topics and back up data

### Storage
- Uses `chrome.storage.sync` to store:
  - `topics` list
  - For each topic:
    - `streak_<topic>`
    - `lastMarkedDate_<topic>`
    - `history_<topic>` (array of dates you've marked it)

### Background Script (background.js)
- Sets a daily reminder using Chrome's alarms API
- Sends a notification once a day

### Google Sheets Backup
- Authenticates with your Google account using OAuth
- Pushes all topic data to a sheet you control
- Uses the Google Sheets API to write rows with:
  - Topic, Streak, LastMarked, TotalDays, History (as JSON)
